# PrimeCheck ðŸ§ âœ¨


## The World's Most Sophisticated Prime Number Detector

Welcome to **PrimeCheck**, the revolutionary tool that uses the computational power of GPT to solve a problem your calculator could handle in microseconds! Why use simple algorithms when you can harness the power of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?

> "I needed to check if 17 was prime. So naturally, I spun up a cloud instance, integrated with OpenAI's API, wrote 250 lines of Go code, and implemented enterprise logging. The answer? Yes. And it only cost me $0.43 cents per check!" - A very reasonable developer

## Features

- **AI-Powered Primality Testing**: Leverage the same technology that can write poetry to... check if numbers have divisors
- **Enterprise-Grade Logging**: Know EXACTLY when your program decided to ask an AI if 2 is prime
- **Blazing-Fast Performance**: Results in mere seconds (compared to the nanoseconds a traditional algorithm would take)
- **Cloud-Ready**: Because your local machine isn't sophisticated enough to determine if 13 is prime
- **Environmental Impact**: Contributes to global warming at a rate proportional to the size of the number being checked

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/florinel-chis/primecheck.git
cd primecheck
go build
```

Don't forget to:

1. Set up your OpenAI API key
2. Take out a small loan to cover token usage
3. Explain to your team why you're using an LLM to check primality

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
./primecheck 17

# With verbose logging (prepare your terminal for an avalanche of information)
./primecheck -v 17

# Save those precious logs for future archaeologists
./primecheck -v 17 2> the-chronicles-of-primality.log

# Check multiple numbers and bankrupt yourself faster
for i in {1..100}; do ./primecheck $i; done
```

## How It Works

1. Your number embarks on an epic journey through the internet
2. It arrives at OpenAI's data centers
3. A model trained on billions of parameters contemplates your number's divisibility properties
4. The answer travels back across the globe
5. Your terminal displays "yes" or "no"
6. You receive an API usage bill

## Performance Benchmarks

| Number | Traditional Algorithm | PrimeCheck |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| 7 | 0.000001ms | 1200ms + API latency |
| 97 | 0.000003ms | 1350ms + API latency |
| 1009 | 0.000008ms | 1400ms + API latency + existential crisis |
